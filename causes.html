        <h1>Causes of Deforestation</h1>
        <p>Forests are disappearing at an alarming rate due to various human activities. Here, we explore the primary causes of deforestation, from agriculture to urbanization, and their impacts on our planet.</p>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Agricultural Expansion</h2>
            <p>The growing demand for food to feed a rising global population is a major driver of deforestation. Large-scale agriculture, particularly for cash crops like soy, palm oil, and coffee, contributes significantly to forest loss, particularly in tropical regions like the Amazon.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Logging</h2>
            <p>Logging for timber and wood-based products leads to significant deforestation. Illegal logging, in particular, has devastating effects, damaging ecosystems and biodiversity in tropical forests.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Infrastructure Development</h2>
            <p>As cities grow and infrastructure expands, forests are cleared for highways, dams, and urban development. Roads, in particular, open up previously untouched forest areas to further exploitation like mining and agriculture.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Production of Fuelwood and Charcoal</h2>
            <p>Many developing nations rely on wood and charcoal for cooking and heating. Unsustainable wood harvesting for fuel results in deforestation, particularly in rural communities with limited access to alternative energy sources.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Fires and Natural Elements</h2>
            <p>Both human-caused and natural forest fires contribute to deforestation. Increasingly frequent and intense wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, are destroying large forest areas, especially in tropical and boreal regions.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cause-item">
            <h2>Urbanization</h2>
            <p>Urbanization is another key factor contributing to deforestation. As cities expand to accommodate growing populations, forests are cleared to make way for homes, businesses, and infrastructure.</p>
